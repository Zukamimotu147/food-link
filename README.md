## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project?

I learn a lot of the backend stuff. It was a hell experience, but I enjoyed it when a feature works.

This is my first "Real" project and to be honest this is nowhere finish. Theres a lot to do to make this Production ready. I might come back to once in a while (If I have strength and happiness to do it.)

Feel free to give feedback and critize my work so I can be better and improve it :)
